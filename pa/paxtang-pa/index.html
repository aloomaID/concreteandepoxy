            <h3>Paxtang, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Paxtang dates to the 18th century when Euro-Americans settled at the site of the Shawnee-Lenape village of Peshtank. The Lenape called the village Peshtank meaning 'where the waters stand' which in English became Paxtang or Paxton. Several important trails and routes developed in the area as the Susquehanna River was easily forded here, making Paxtang an ideal location for the movement of people and trade goods across the river.</p>
